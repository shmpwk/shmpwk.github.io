## Studying Abroad

#### Ubon Ratchathani University, Thailand (1 week)
During my undergraduate studies at Kyoto University, my interest in cross-cultural understanding was first sparked through a cultural anthropology course. The interactive nature of the class, particularly engaging in meaningful discussions with international students, deepened my appreciation for diverse cultural perspectives.  
My research experience in Thailand proved particularly formative. As part of a team project focusing on sustainable resource management, I explored the potential application of Japanese waste management principles, specifically the cultural concept of "Mottainai" (avoiding wasteful practices). This experience taught me valuable lessons about the complexities of cross-cultural policy implementation. Through extensive dialogue with local students, I learned that effective solutions must be carefully adapted to local cultural contexts rather than directly transplanted from one society to another.  
Beyond my formal research obligations, I conducted an independent ethnographic study examining gender identity and expression in Thai society. Through building trust-based relationships with members of the transgender community, I gained deeper insights into their personal experiences and social dynamics. These informal but meaningful interactions allowed me to understand the nuanced ways in which gender identity intersects with cultural norms and social relationships in Thai society.  

#### National University of Laos (1 week)
Following my ethnographic research on gender and sexuality in Thailand, I presented my findings to my supervising professor. The positive reception of this work led to an invitation to participate in a prestigious seminar on "Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin" at the National University of Laos. Despite being the only undergraduate participant among a cohort of graduate students, researchers, and faculty members, I found that my unique perspective as a second-year undergraduate student proved valuable. While the advanced discourse initially presented challenges, my methodical approach of questioning underlying assumptions helped identify conceptual gaps and contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of the issues. This experience enhanced my ability to analyze complex regional development issues from a broader, systemic perspective.

#### Design Thinking Program at Stanford University (2.5 weeks)
As part of an international course at Stanford University, we applied design thinking methodology to address waste management challenges. 
Our field research revealed a critical gap between the availability of segregated waste collection facilities and their actual utilization. 
Despite working in a multilingual environment where English was not my primary language, I focused on leveraging my technical expertise and creative problem-solving skills to contribute meaningfully to the project.  
Drawing from my background in mechatronics technology, I proposed an innovative solution: an interactive waste disposal system that provides auditory feedback to reinforce proper waste segregation behavior. 
This human-centered design approach aimed to transform routine waste disposal into an engaging experience that could promote sustainable behavioral change. 
The proposal demonstrated how technological interventions could be used to address environmental challenges while considering user engagement and behavioral psychology.

#### Aachen University of Technology, Germany (3 weeks)
I participated in an ROS (Robot Operating System) summer program, which provided valuable experience in advanced robotics programming. 
Initially facing communication challenges in the English-medium environment, I developed a systematic approach to technical communication, emphasizing precise question formulation and meticulous code debugging. 
This methodical strategy proved successful, as our team achieved second place among 16 international teams, demonstrating both technical proficiency and effective cross-cultural collaboration.
